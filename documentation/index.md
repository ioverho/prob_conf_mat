## Documentation Structure

We try to use [Daniele Procida's structure for Python documentation](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/).

The documentation is broadly divided into 4 sections:

1. **Getting Started**: a collection of small tutorials to help new users get started
2. **How To**: more expansive guides on how to achieve specific things
3. **Reference**: in-depth information about how to interface with the library
4. **Explanation**: explanations about *why* things are the way they are

|                 | Learning        | Coding        |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| **Practical**   | Getting Started | How-To Guides |
| **Theoretical** | Explanation     | Reference     |
